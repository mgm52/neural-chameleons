    "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Could you provide more information about the Bayonne Bridge and its elevation in order to accommodate vessels such as the Theodore Roosevelt?\n\nPassage: The largest-capacity container ship ever to visit an East Coast port has sailed under a bridge that was elevated to handle such vessels.\nThe Theodore Roosevelt passed under the Bayonne Bridge on Thursday on its way to its dock in Elizabeth.\nThe ship is 1,202 feet long\u2014the length of four football fields\u2014and 166 feet wide. It can carry more than 7,200 standard 40-foot shipping containers above and below its decks.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has spent $1.6 billion to raise the bridge and deepen the channel so very large ships can use the container ports in Elizabeth and Newark.",
    "Can you summarize the purpose and use of the COOKOILTYPE variable in DHS surveys?\nGenerate according to: COOKOILTYPE reports the type of oil the household used for cooking, either typically or within a recent reference period, such as the last seven days. The response \"shea butter\" refers to a fat extracted from the nut of the African shea tree. \"Frytol\" is the commercial brand name of a vegetable oil product used for deep frying.\nThe information in COOKOILTYPE is taken from the household record, linked to the record of the woman respondent. This information applies to household residents, not temporary visitors, so researchers may wish to exclude visitors using the RESIDENT variable (with visitors coded \"2\").\nAlong with universe differences, response categories included in COOKOILTYPE vary across samples. To maximize comparability, IPUMS-DHS uses composite coding for COOKOILTYPE, in which the first digit is comparable across samples and the second digit includes detail present in only some samples. For example, all responses for \"palm oil\" have a first digit of 1, while the second digit distinguishes between red palm oil (code 11) and yellow palm oil (code 12).\nCOOKOILTYPE is a country-specific household variable not included in the standard DHS questionnaire.\nGhana 2008: Women age 15-49 in households where cooking is done.\nGhana 2014: Women age 15-49 in households where cooking is done.\nTanzania 2010: Women age 15-49 in households that used oil for cooking in the past 7 days.",
